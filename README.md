# SRM Datathon 2025 : Demand Forecasting & Inventory Optimization

This repository houses my solution for the SRM Datathon, organized by the Faculty of Management at SRM Institute of Science and Management. I tackled a real-world challenge for a heavy machinery manufacturer company, to predict daily sales and optimize inventory levels. My project blends advanced machine learning with practical optimization, delivering a high-performance, business-ready model.

## Problem Statement :

1) Objective : Predict future daily sales for machinery (e.g., Backhoe Loaders, Excavators) and optimize inventory within a 5000 cubic meter constraint.
2) Criteria : Accuracy, optimization strategy, business impact, scalability, technical excellence.

## Solution Highlights
Demand Forecasting Model : Built an ensemble of XGBoost, LSTM, Prophet, and LightGBM, achieving:

1) R² Score: 0.9997 (99.97% accuracy)
2) MAE: 10.37
3) MSE: 198.58
4) RMSE: 14.09

Inventory Optimization : Implemented a MILP-based strategy to minimize holding costs and stockouts, adhering to space limits.

## Tech Stack : 
1) Python
2) Numpy
3) Pandas
4) Scikit-learn
5) TensorFlow
6) Streamlit (for UI)

## Models used : 
1) XGBoost
2) Prophet
3) LightGBM
4) PuLP
5) LSTM (Long Short Term Memory)

## Key Features
✅ Precision: Near-perfect sales predictions with robust generalization.
✅ Scalability: Adaptable to fluctuating market conditions.
✅ Visualization: Tharun’s stunning visuals enhanced interpretability.
✅ Business Value: Practical inventory allocation for operational efficiency.
